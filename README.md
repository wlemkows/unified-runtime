## Integration

The recommended way to integrate this project into another is via CMake's
[FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html),
for example:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
    unified-runtime
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/oneapi-src/unified-runtime.git
    GIT_TAG main  # This will pull the latest changes from the main branch.
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(unified-runtime)

add_executable(example example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(example PUBLIC unified-runtime::headers)
```

### Weekly tags

Each Friday at 23:00 UTC time a [prerelease
tag](https://github.com/oneapi-src/unified-runtime/releases) is created which
takes the form `weekly-YYYY-MM-DD`. These tags should be used by downstream
projects which intend to track development closely but maintain a fixed point in
history to avoid pulling potentially breaking changes from the `main` branch.

## Third-Party tools

Tools can be acquired via instructions in [third_party](/third_party/README.md).

## Building

The requirements and instructions below are for building the project from source
without any modifications. To make modifications to the specification, please
see the
[Contribution Guide](https://oneapi-src.github.io/unified-runtime/core/CONTRIB.html)
for more detailed instructions on the correct setup.

### Requirements

Required packages:
- C++ compiler with C++17 support
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) >= 3.14.0
- Python v3.6.6 or later

### Windows

Generating Visual Studio Project. EXE and binaries will be in **build/bin/{build_config}**

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake {path_to_source_dir} -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
```

### Linux

Executable and binaries will be in **build/bin**

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake {path_to_source_dir}
$ make
```

### Additional make targets

To run automated code formatting, configure CMake with `UR_FORMAT_CPP_STYLE` option
and then run a custom `cppformat` target:

```bash
$ make cppformat
```

If you've made modifications to the specification, you can also run
a custom `generate` target prior to building.
It will generate the source code **and** run automated code formatting:

```bash
$ make generate
```

This target has additional dependencies which are described in the *Build
Environment* section of the
[Contribution Guide](https://oneapi-src.github.io/unified-runtime/core/CONTRIB.html).

## Contributions

For those who intend to make a contribution to the project please read our
[Contribution Guide](https://oneapi-src.github.io/unified-runtime/core/CONTRIB.html)
for more information.

### Adapter naming convention

To maintain consistency and clarity in naming adapter libraries, it is recommended
to use the following naming convention:

* On Linux platforms, use `libur_adapter_[name].so`.
* On Windows platforms, use `ur_adapter_[name].dll`.

### Source code generation

Code is generated using included [Python scripts](/scripts/README.md).

### Documentation

Documentation is generated from source code using Sphinx -
see [scripts dir](/scripts/README.md) for details.

## Release Process

Unified Runtime releases are aligned with oneAPI releases. Once all changes
planned for a release have been accepted, the release process is defined as:

1. Create a new release branch based on the [main][main-branch] branch taking
   the form `v<major>.<minor>.x` where `x` is a placeholder for the patch
   version. This branch will always contain the latest patch version for a given
   release.
2. Create a PR to increment the CMake project version on the [main][main-branch]
   and merge before accepting any other changes.
3. Create a new tag based on the latest commit on the release branch taking the
   form `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.
4. Create a [new GitHub release][new-github-release] using the tag created in
   the previous step.
   * Prior to version 1.0, check the *Set as a pre-release* tick box.
5. Update downstream projects to utilize the release tag. If any issues arise
   from integration, apply any necessary hot fixes to `v<major>.<minor>.x`
   branch and go back to step 3.
